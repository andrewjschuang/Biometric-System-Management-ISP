live test
branch 0.1.0

changes made
- kept full resolution instead of halving the image

results
1. some false positives
2. still some false negatives
    2a. maybe the true positives weren't collected due to [1]
    2b. some seem that were due to capturing side of face
3. a bit of a laggy performance

next strategies / changes to do
- rename saved files putting the date first for file ordering
- have more than 1 encoding photo per person (use the average strategy)
- use a separate and temporary database to avoid duplicates for unknown people (may cause performance issues)
- saving which encoding was used to compare (or encodings if average strategy was used)
- face encodings without smiling (more natural)
- save face distance
- possibly use a stricter tolerance
