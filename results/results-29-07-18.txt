branch 0.1.0

changes made
- kept full resolution instead of halving the image

results
1. some false positives
2. still some false negatives
    2a. maybe the true positives weren't collected due to [1]
    2b. some seems that were do to capturing side of face
3. a bit of slow performance

next strategies / changes to do
- rename saved files putting date first for ordering
- save more than 1 photo per person
- use an unknown database for less duplicates for unknown people
- use the various average strategy
- saving which encoding was used to compare (or encodings if average used)
- face encodings without smile (more natural)
