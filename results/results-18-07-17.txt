objectives
get one person's encoding (best for a set of encodings) and test to see if there
are false positives and false negatives.
find good tolerance value
obtain measures for good accuracy

encoding(s) used
top_smilling_glasses

strategy employed
scan for all faces in picture
get the one with least face distance

results
almost no false positives (except 0.4 and 0.39)
very few false negatives due to sideways faces and/or low resolution (not focused)
most detections in the interval [0.25, 0.35]
very few "false positives" in the interval [0.42, 0.45]

conclusions
tolerance=0.4 is acceptable
measures for good accuracy
    - pictures up close
    - good resolution
    - frontal face (no sideways)
    - encoding with glasses for whoever wears them
    - decent lighting (not too bright nor too dark)

next steps
would getting average of encodings be better for accuracy?
use a set of encodings and see if problems arise
